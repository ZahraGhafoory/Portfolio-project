     <p>Afghanistan's cities showcase a blend of ancient traditions and modern influences, 
      reflecting the country's rich cultural heritage and diverse ethnic makeup.
      Kabul, the capital, serves as a regional cultural hub, while Herat and Mazar-e-Sharif, 
      with their Qataghani style, also hold significant cultural importance.

       <p> The culture of Afghanistan has persisted for centuries and encompasses the cultural diversity of the nation.<br>
       Afghanistan's culture is historically strongly connected to nearby Persia, including the same religion, as the people of both countries have lived together for thousands of years.
       Its location at the crossroads of Central, South and Western Asia historically made it a hub of diversity, dubbed by one historian as the "roundabout of the ancient world".
      </p>
<br>  <p> Afghanistan is a mostly tribal society with different regions of the country having their own subculture.
       Despite this, nearly all Afghans follow Islamic traditions, celebrate the same holidays, dress the same, 
       consume the same food, listen to the same music and use Persian as the inter-ethnic lingua franca to a certain extent. 
       Its culture is strongly tied with elements of Central Asia, which can be seen in the likes of language, cuisine and classical music.
      </p>
<br>  <p>Afghan culture is increasingly becoming a dynamic realm of academic study in scholarly terms. 
      In more recent history, Afghan culture has been threatened and fragmented due to the prolonged conflict in the country.
